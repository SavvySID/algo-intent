# Algo Intent - User Interface

Algo Intent is a dual-experience project for the Algorand ecosystem:

- **A conversational, AI-powered Telegram bot** to manage wallets, transfer ALGO, mint/transfer NFTs, and more.
- **A modern web app** (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind) named algointent that brings similar intent-driven actions to the browser with wallet connectivity and a swap widget.

Both experiences share the same vision: describe what you want to do in plain English, and let the system translate that into secure Algorand transactions.
